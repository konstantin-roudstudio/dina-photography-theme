        <p>Before becoming a photographer, I was working in the corporate space, specifically in the sales sector. While I was successful for many years in this work, I wasn’t happy and eventually found the courage to make a change in my professional life.</p>
        <p>I’d always had an interest in photography. Once I’d left the corporate world, I bought my first camera to see if I was any good. I began my journey as a professional photographer by taking pictures of random scenes and people, and it was from here I fell in love with everything about this field.</p>
        <p>I felt at home capturing art and connecting with my subjects both in person and through a lens, and I was transformed into a more sensitive, perceptive, and attuned person because of it.</p>
        <p>My imagination is also sparked by motherhood, romance, and perfect pairings of angles and light. My favourite memories to capture are intimate glances and laughs, sweet cuddles, and humble beauty.</p>
